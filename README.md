## 🛠️ **Key Features**
- **Mechanical Pencil Function** ✏️: The pen can write on paper using lead, just like a traditional mechanical pencil.
- **Electronic Pen Function** 🖥️: The pen transmits **position** and **pressure data** to a position detecting device (e.g., a digital tablet).
- **Pen Pressure Detection** ⚖️: The pen detects **writing pressure** with high accuracy using an **off-axis pen pressure detector**.
- **Eraser Function** 🧽 (Optional): Some versions include an eraser that can erase marks on paper and transmit erasing pressure data.
- **Compatibility** 🔄: Works with both **electromagnetic resonance (EMR)** and **capacitive coupling (AES)** systems.

## 🗂️ **Structure and Components**
The electronic pen is composed of the following key components:

### 1. **Writing Device** ✍️
   - **First Portion (10A)**:
     - **Tapered Pen Tip** 🖋️: Allows lead to protrude for writing.
     - **Lead Delivery Mechanism** ⚙️: Includes a **chuck section (10A3)** and **lead chuck (10A2)** to hold and release lead.
   - **Second Portion (10B)**:
     - **Lead Insertion Port (10S)** 🕳️: Allows users to insert new lead from the rear end.

### 2. **Pen Pressure Transmitter (14)** 📤
   - **Tubular Portion (14A)**: Transmits pressure from the pen tip.
   - **Extension Portion (14B)**: Redirects pressure to the **pen pressure detector**.
   - **Pressing Portion (14C)**: Presses against the **pen pressure detector**.

### 3. **Pen Pressure Detector (15)** 📏
   - Detects **writing pressure** and converts it into an electronic signal.
   - Located **off-axis** to avoid obstructing lead insertion.

### 4. **Inner Casing (13)** 🏠
   - Houses the **pen pressure transmitter**, **pen pressure detector**, and **writing device**.
   - Includes **mounting sections** for the **circuit board** and other components.

### 5. **Core Section (11)** 🌀
   - Contains a **ferrite core (11A)** and **coil (11B)** for signal transmission (EMR).

### 6. **Circuit Board (16)** 🖥️
   - Contains the **resonance circuit** (for EMR) or **oscillation circuit** (for AES).
   - Processes signals from the **pen pressure detector**.

### 7. **Outer Casing (17)** 🛡️
   - Protects internal components and provides a comfortable grip.
   - Includes a **rear holding member (18)** for the **knocker**.

### 8. **Knocker (19)** 🔨
   - Allows users to deliver lead by pressing the knocker at the rear end.

### 9. **Eraser Unit (Optional)** 🧽
   - Includes an **eraser (10F)** and **pressure transmitter (21 or 22)**.
   - Detects erasing pressure and transmits it to the position detecting device.

## 🔧 **How It Works**
1. **Writing Mode** ✍️:
   - The user writes on paper using the **mechanical pencil function**.
   - The **pen pressure detector** detects the writing pressure and transmits it to the **position detecting device**.

2. **Eraser Mode** 🧽 (Optional):
   - The user erases marks on paper using the **eraser**.
   - The **eraser pressure detector** detects the erasing pressure and transmits it to the **position detecting device**.

3. **Signal Transmission** 📡:
   - The pen transmits **position** and **pressure data** to the position detecting device using either **EMR** or **AES** technology.
